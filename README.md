Healthcare Dataset Analysis

Welcome to my Healthcare Dataset Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my ability to analyze healthcare data using SQL. Below, you'll find the project objectives, key insights, and links to the dataset and code.

üåê Objective

The primary aim of this project is to analyze a healthcare dataset to extract meaningful insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital operations, and revenue generation. The goal is to provide actionable insights for better decision-making in the healthcare sector.

üìù Goals

Understand patient demographics and trends.

Identify the most common medical conditions.

Analyze hospital revenue and resource allocation.

Examine admission and discharge patterns.

Highlight patient and doctor interactions.

üîç Key Insights

1. Most Common Diagnoses

Diabetes is the most prevalent medical condition, followed by Hypertension and Obesity.

Chronic conditions dominate the top diagnoses, indicating a significant focus on long-term care.

2. Patient Age Distribution

The largest group of patients falls within the 36-60 age range, indicating a middle-aged population as the primary healthcare users.

Younger patients (0-18) and senior citizens (60+) constitute smaller proportions of the dataset.

3. Admission Trends

Admissions have steadily increased over the years, with notable peaks in recent times, possibly due to population growth or expanded healthcare access.

4. Average Length of Stay

Chronic conditions like Diabetes and Arthritis result in longer hospital stays compared to acute conditions.

Efficient management of acute conditions helps reduce hospital congestion.

5. Revenue Analysis

Cancer treatments contribute the highest revenue, with significantly higher average billing amounts than other conditions.

Chronic conditions also generate consistent revenue streams due to ongoing care requirements.

6. Frequent Patients

A subset of patients with chronic conditions, such as Diabetes and Hypertension, frequently revisit hospitals, emphasizing the need for continuous care.

7. Doctor-Patient Ratios

Smaller hospitals often have lower doctor-to-patient ratios, indicating potential resource constraints.

Larger hospitals are better equipped to handle high patient volumes.

8. Demographics by Diagnosis

Gender and age patterns are evident in certain conditions; for instance, Hypertension is more common among older males.

Such patterns can inform targeted healthcare campaigns and interventions.

9. High-Cost Patients

The highest costs are associated with complex treatments for Cancer and Heart Disease.

Managing these conditions effectively can reduce financial strain on patients and hospitals.
