## **üîç Key Insights**

**1. Most Common Diagnoses**

Chronic illnesses like Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity dominate the dataset.

Cancer treatments generate the highest revenue, requiring substantial hospital resources.

**2. Patient Demographics**

Middle-aged adults (36-60) form the largest patient group.

Hypertension is more prevalent among older males, while younger patients show lower admission rates.

**3. Revenue Analysis**

Chronic conditions ensure consistent revenue streams.

Cancer treatments yield significantly higher average costs than other conditions.

**4. Admission Trends**

Hospital admissions have shown steady growth, with occasional peaks likely influenced by external factors like population growth.

**5. Average Length of Stay**

Chronic conditions like Arthritis result in longer hospital stays compared to acute conditions, emphasizing the need for efficient management.

**6. Doctor-Patient Ratios**

Smaller hospitals face resource constraints with lower doctor-to-patient ratios.

Larger hospitals are better equipped to manage higher patient volumes.
