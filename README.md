Healthcare Data Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my Healthcare Data Analyst Portfolio! This project showcases my skills in SQL for analyzing a healthcare dataset, extracting meaningful insights, and providing actionable recommendations. Below, you will find an overview of the project, key insights, and how to access the code.

üè• Project Overview
This portfolio project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset to uncover trends, patient demographics, revenue insights, and operational efficiencies in the healthcare sector. The analysis focuses on:

Understanding patient demographics and medical trends.
Identifying revenue drivers and cost-contributing factors.
Exploring hospital operations such as admissions, discharge patterns, and resource allocation.

üìä Key Insights
1. Most Common Diagnoses
Diabetes is the most prevalent diagnosis, followed by Hypertension and Obesity.
Chronic conditions dominate the list, highlighting the need for specialized care programs.
2. Patient Age Distribution
The majority of patients fall within the 36‚Äì60 age range, showcasing the primary demographic requiring healthcare.
Senior citizens (60+) and children (0‚Äì18) make up smaller yet significant patient groups.
3. Admission Trends
Admission numbers have steadily increased over the years, with noticeable peaks due to growing population or healthcare access expansions.
4. Revenue Breakdown
Cancer treatments generate the highest revenue, with chronic diseases contributing consistent revenue streams due to recurring care needs.
5. Length of Stay
Chronic conditions such as Diabetes and Arthritis result in longer hospital stays, whereas acute conditions have shorter durations, improving hospital turnover rates.
6. Doctor-Patient Ratios
Larger hospitals are better staffed, while smaller facilities face resource constraints with lower doctor-to-patient ratios.
7. High-Cost Patients
Patients treated for Cancer and Heart Disease incur the highest costs due to the complexity of their treatments.
