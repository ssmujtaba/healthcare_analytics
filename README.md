| Medical Condition   | Length of Stay   | Billing Amount   |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Asthma              | 15.6966          | 25635.2          |
| Arthritis           | 15.5174          | 25497.3          |

dtypes: float64(2), object(1)
memory usage: 192.0+ bytes
None

**Insight**

I've added a new column named Billing Amount Per Day. This column represents the average amount billed per day for each patient. I can then use this new feature to perform further analysis, such as:

* Comparing the billing amount per day across different medical conditions.
* Analyzing the relationship between billing amount per day and length of stay
* Identifying patients with unusually high or low billing amounts per day

üìù Additional Notes:

* The Python code was developed and executed using Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.
* The visualizations generated from the Python analysis are included in the 'Healthcare Analysis.pdf' file.

## ‚ú® Conclusion

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to leverage both SQL and Python to analyze and visualize healthcare data. üí™ The combination of these powerful tools allows for a comprehensive understanding of patient healthcare utilization, costs, and potential trends. üí°
